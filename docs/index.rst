The MolSSI Documentation Theme
=========================================================

This website demonstrates the new MolSSI Documentation theme,
and explains how to migrate your project's documentation.

There are two parts to updating to the new documentaiton theme:

1. Changing your Sphinx theme.
2. Switching to the Diataxis documentation framework.

The `Getting Started <getting_started/index.html>`_ page describes how to
update your Sphinx theme. This will make your documentation use the 
`PyData Sphinx Theme <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ with MolSSI customization, and explains how to achieve the
grid on the front page.

To update your documentation to follow the `Diataxis framework <https://diataxis.fr/>`_, 
we recommend reading the `How To Guide <https://diataxis.fr/how-to-use-diataxis/>`_. 
Note that it may take some time to change documentation to fit this framework, 
and that it may be relevant to varying degrees.

You should be able to achieve updating the theme without fully updating your documentation structure.
